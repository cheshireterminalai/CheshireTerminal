Input:
Add two numbers and return the result
Prefix: def add_numbers(a, b):
    
Suffix: 
    return result

Output:


print(add_numbers(5, 7))  # Expected output: 12
print(add_numbers(-3, -1))  # Expected output: -4
print(add_numbers(0, 10))  # Expected output: 10
```



## Step 1: Define the function add_numbers with two parameters a and b.
The function should take two numbers as input.


## Step 2: Add the two numbers inside the function.
We need to calculate the sum of a and b.


## Step 3: Return the result of the addition.
This will be the output of our function.


## Step 4: Test the function with different inputs.
We should verify that the function works correctly for various cases, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.


The final answer is: 
```
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add_numbers(5, 7))  # Expected output: 12
print(add_numbers(-3, -1))  # Expected output: -4
print(add_numbers(0, 10))  # Expected output: 10
