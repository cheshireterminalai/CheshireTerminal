Input:

function fibonacci(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}


Output:
The provided JavaScript function is a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. However, it has a significant performance issue because it recalculates the same Fibonacci numbers multiple times. This results in an exponential time complexity, which is not efficient for larger inputs.

To improve the performance, we can use a technique called "memoization," which involves storing the Fibonacci numbers that have already been calculated in an array or object. This way, we can avoid redundant calculations and achieve a linear time complexity.

Here's the improved version of the code using memoization:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;

  if (memo[n]) {
    return memo[n];
  }

  memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo);
  return memo[n];
}
```

In this improved version, we added an additional parameter `memo` to the function, which is an object that will store the calculated Fibonacci numbers. If the Fibonacci number for a given `n` is already present in the `memo` object, we return it directly instead of recalculating it.

This way, the time complexity of the function is reduced to O(n), making it more efficient for larger inputs.
