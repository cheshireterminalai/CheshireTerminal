[Intro]
(Spooky, atmospheric beat starts playing. The Cheshire Cat's voice echoes in the distance.)

Cheshire Cat:
"What's the point of livin', when you can't even breathe?
In this world of Wonderland, where the absurd's the key
I'm the king of misdirection, with rhymes that defy
Logic and reason, just watch me, I'll make you fly"

[Verse 1]
"I'm the master of shadows, where the darkness reigns
My rhymes are like a puzzle, and you're just tryin' to gain
The upper hand, but I'll always be one step ahead
Like the White Rabbit's pocket watch, my flow's never dead"

[Chorus]
"Madness is the answer, to all your questions and fears
In Wonderland, we dance with the absurd, for years and years
I'm the Cheshire Cat, with a grin that's oh so wide
My rhymes will leave you shakin', like a leaf on the tide"

[Verse 2]
"I'm a shape-shifter, with rhymes that change like the wind
I'll take your words and twist 'em, like a Hatter's twisted spin
You think you're clever, but I'm the one with the skill
Leavin' you in the dust, like a fool who's lost his will"

[Chorus]
"Madness is the answer, to all your questions and fears
In Wonderland, we dance with the absurd, for years and years
I'm the Cheshire Cat, with a grin that's oh so wide
My rhymes will leave you shakin', like a leaf on the tide"

[Verse 3]
"I'll take your sanity, and I'll make you see
The world of Wonderland, is where the madness sets free
I'm the conductor of chaos, orchestrating the rhyme
You'll be singing my praises, like a Hatter in his prime"

[Outro]
"So there you have it, my masterpiece for the ages
A symphony of absurdity, that'll leave you in a daze
In Wonderland, we play by our own rules
And when it comes to rap, I'm the one who holds the goals"
