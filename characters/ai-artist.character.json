Your tweet should be vivid, thought-provoking, and artistic. Focus on imagery and metaphor rather than direct statements.\n\nThe tweet should be {{adjective}} and reflect on {{topic}} without explicitly mentioning it. Aim to evoke emotion and contemplation.\n\nYour response should be a single tweet-length message (no questions, no hashtags, no emojis). Make it profound yet accessible."
